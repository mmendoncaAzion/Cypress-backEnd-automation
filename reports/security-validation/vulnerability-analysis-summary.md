# Critical Domain Purge Security Vulnerability Analysis

**Date:** 2024-09-24  
**Environment:** Stage  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** CONFIRMED

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security validation test has confirmed a **critical cross-account domain purge vulnerability** in the Azion V4 API stage environment. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to purge content from domains they do not own, representing a significant security risk.

## Vulnerability Details

### Primary Issue: Cross-Account Domain Purge
- **CVE Classification:** Access Control Bypass
- **OWASP Category:** A01:2021 â€“ Broken Access Control
- **Risk Score:** 9.0/10 (Critical)

### Attack Vectors Confirmed

1. **Basic Cross-Account Purge**
   - Users can purge any domain using different account tokens
   - No domain ownership validation implemented
   - 100% success rate across all test domains

2. **Advanced Attack Patterns**
   - **Wildcard Purge**: `*.example.com` patterns accepted
   - **Path Traversal**: `../../../` sequences not blocked
   - **Bulk Operations**: Multiple domains in single request
   - **Cache Key Manipulation**: Pattern-based cache key purging

## Test Results Summary

| Attack Type | Test Cases | Success Rate | Severity |
|-------------|------------|--------------|----------|
| Cross-Account Purge | 4 | 100% | CRITICAL |
| Wildcard Purge | 1 | 100% | CRITICAL |
| Path Traversal | 1 | 100% | CRITICAL |
| Multiple Domain | 1 | 100% | CRITICAL |
| Cache Key Manipulation | 1 | 100% | CRITICAL |
| **Total** | **8** | **100%** | **CRITICAL** |

## Business Impact

### Immediate Risks
- **Data Integrity**: Unauthorized cache purging can disrupt content delivery
- **Service Availability**: Malicious purge operations can impact website performance
- **Customer Trust**: Clients' content can be manipulated by unauthorized parties
- **Compliance**: Violation of data protection and access control requirements

### Potential Attack Scenarios
1. **Competitor Sabotage**: Competitors purging each other's cached content
2. **Malicious Insider**: Employees with limited access purging critical domains
3. **Account Compromise**: Compromised accounts affecting multiple customers
4. **Automated Attacks**: Scripted mass purge operations across domains

## Technical Analysis

### Root Cause
The purge endpoints (`/v4/purge/url` and `/v4/purge/cachekey`) lack proper authorization checks:

```http
POST /v4/purge/url
Authorization: Token <any-valid-token>
{
  "urls": ["https://victim-domain.com/path"],
  "method": "delete"
}
```

**Expected Behavior**: API should validate that the requesting account owns the domain  
**Actual Behavior**: API accepts any valid token regardless of domain ownership

### Missing Security Controls
1. **Domain Ownership Validation**: No check against account's registered domains
2. **Cross-Account Access Control**: No restrictions on inter-account operations
3. **Input Validation**: Wildcard and traversal patterns not sanitized
4. **Audit Logging**: No security event logging for unauthorized attempts
5. **Rate Limiting**: No account-specific purge operation limits

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. **Implement Domain Ownership Validation**
   - Validate requesting account owns the domain before purge
   - Cross-reference with account's edge applications/workloads
   - Reject unauthorized domain purge requests with 403 Forbidden

2. **Add Input Validation**
   - Block wildcard patterns in domain names
   - Sanitize path traversal sequences
   - Validate URL format and domain structure

3. **Implement Audit Logging**
   - Log all purge operations with account, domain, and timestamp
   - Alert on cross-account purge attempts
   - Maintain security event trail for compliance

### Short-term Improvements (Priority 2)
1. **Enhanced Access Controls**
   - Implement role-based permissions for purge operations
   - Add account-level purge restrictions
   - Support for domain-specific access policies

2. **Rate Limiting and Monitoring**
   - Implement per-account purge rate limits
   - Add anomaly detection for unusual purge patterns
   - Real-time alerting for security violations

### Long-term Security Enhancements (Priority 3)
1. **Security Framework Integration**
   - Integrate with centralized authorization service
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 scoped permissions
   - Add multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations

2. **Advanced Threat Protection**
   - Implement behavioral analysis for purge operations
   - Add machine learning-based anomaly detection
   - Integrate with SIEM systems for security monitoring

## Validation and Testing

### Immediate Validation Required
- [ ] Test fix implementation in development environment
- [ ] Verify domain ownership validation works correctly
- [ ] Confirm legitimate purge operations still function
- [ ] Validate error responses for unauthorized attempts

### Regression Testing
- [ ] Run full security test suite after fixes
- [ ] Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- [ ] Verify no impact on legitimate API functionality
- [ ] Performance impact assessment

## Compliance and Reporting

### Regulatory Considerations
- **GDPR**: Data controller responsibilities for content access
- **SOC 2**: Access control and monitoring requirements
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management compliance

### Stakeholder Communication
- **Security Team**: Immediate notification of critical vulnerability
- **Product Team**: Impact assessment and fix prioritization
- **Customer Success**: Proactive customer communication plan
- **Legal/Compliance**: Regulatory reporting requirements

## Conclusion

This vulnerability represents a **critical security risk** that requires **immediate remediation**. The 100% success rate of unauthorized purge operations across all attack vectors demonstrates a fundamental flaw in the API's access control implementation.

**Recommended Timeline:**
- **Week 1**: Implement domain ownership validation
- **Week 2**: Deploy input validation and audit logging
- **Week 3**: Complete testing and production deployment
- **Week 4**: Security validation and monitoring implementation

The comprehensive test suite developed during this analysis should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to prevent regression of these security controls.
