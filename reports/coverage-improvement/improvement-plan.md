# API Test Coverage Improvement Plan

**Generated:** 2025-09-24T13:33:14.569Z  
**Current Coverage:** 8%  
**Target Coverage:** 90%  
**Missing Endpoints:** 219

## Executive Summary

Our Cypress API test suite currently covers only **8%** of the Azion V4 API endpoints. This represents a significant gap in our testing strategy and poses risks to:

- **Security**: Critical auth and firewall endpoints lack validation
- **Functionality**: Core CDN features are not properly tested
- **Compliance**: Incomplete API validation for regulatory requirements
- **Maintenance**: Large technical debt in test coverage

## Current State Analysis

### Coverage Statistics
- **Total Endpoints**: 239
- **Covered**: 19
- **Missing**: 219
- **Extra/Obsolete**: 182

### Critical Gaps
- Authentication endpoints (18 missing) - Security risk
- Edge Application (36 missing) - Core functionality
- Edge Firewall (29 missing) - Security features
- Orchestrator (27 missing) - Complete category gap

- **Impact:** High
- **Timeline:** 2-3 days
- **Coverage Increase:** 4%


### Create auth flow validation tests
- **Effort:** Medium
- **Impact:** Critical
- **Timeline:** 3-5 days
- **Coverage Increase:** 7%


### Implement edge application basic tests
- **Effort:** Medium
- **Impact:** High
- **Timeline:** 5-7 days
- **Coverage Increase:** 15%


### Add error handling tests for existing endpoints
- **Effort:** Low
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Timeline:** 2-3 days
- **Coverage Increase:** 3%


## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- API rate limiting may slow test execution
- Environment stability issues in stage/dev
- Authentication token management complexity
- Large test suite may impact CI/CD pipeline performance

### Business Risks
- Resource allocation for comprehensive test development
- Coordination with API development team for changes
- Potential discovery of additional bugs/issues
- Timeline pressure vs quality trade-offs

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement intelligent test parallelization
- Use test data factories for consistent setup
- Add retry mechanisms for flaky tests
- Implement progressive test rollout strategy

## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Update Postman collection analysis script
- [ ] Enhance test data factories
- [ ] Implement advanced payload generators
- [ ] Set up parallel test execution infrastructure

### Required Tooling
- [ ] Automated test generator based on OpenAPI/Postman specs
- [ ] Enhanced reporting and coverage tracking
- [ ] CI/CD integration improvements
- [ ] Test data management system

### Best Practices
- Use data-driven testing for payload variations
- Implement proper test isolation and cleanup
- Add comprehensive error scenario testing
- Include performance benchmarks in tests
- Maintain test documentation and examples

### Quality Gates
- Minimum 90% endpoint coverage before production deployment
- All critical security endpoints must have comprehensive tests
- Performance tests for high-traffic endpoints
- Error handling validation for all endpoints

## Success Metrics

- **Coverage Target**: 90% of all API endpoints
- **Quality Target**: 100% of critical security endpoints
- **Performance Target**: Test suite execution under 30 minutes
- **Reliability Target**: <5% flaky test rate

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Implement quick wins (account + auth tests)
2. **Week 2**: Begin Phase 1 implementation
3. **Week 3**: Continuous integration improvements
4. **Week 4**: Phase 2 planning and execution
5. **Ongoing**: Regular coverage monitoring and improvement
